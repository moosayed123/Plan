## TEAM 1 
### Automated attendence system
Project Overview:
A complete school system consists of three main steps:
Attendance and Access Control at the School Gate:
The system identifies attendance at the school gate. When a recognized person is detected, their attendance is recorded on our platform, and the gate is opened for them.
If an unrecognized person is detected, a message is sent to the supervisor, such as Mr. Mohamed Adly or Mr. Ahmed Fouad, to decide whether to allow entry.
Student Assistance System:
This step involves helping students with their questions about the school without the need to approach school supervisors, thereby minimizing disruption to their work.
Substitute Class Management System:
Mr. Ahmed Fouad, who specializes in scheduling, uses this system to manage substitute classes. Teachers are notified when they have a substitute class scheduled, and they are also reminded of their sessions to avoid delays.
Additionally, the system rings the school bell for each class and break, eliminating the need for a supervisor to do so manually.
